### Reinforcement learning

Reinforcement learning works through trial and error which actions yield the greatest rewards. Used in places where we have a computer learning to play a video game, or a machine learning to drive a car and so on. 

#### Components of Reinforcement learning

* Agent: Learning/Decision maker
* Environment: What the agent interacts with
* Actions: What the agent can do

So what happens in case of reinforcement learning is that the agent chooses actions that maximizes some reward metric over a given amount of time. Basically learning the **`best policy`**

## General steps in machine learning

<h3 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Note that general steps in Machine learning do not always comply with reinforcement learning. The steps in reinforcement learning are a little different on its own</h3>

* Data acquisition
* Data cleaning(normalization and so on)
* Train, Test split(30%, 70% ---30 % being test and the other being train)
* Train model
* Evaluate model(using test set)
